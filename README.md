## Which design pattern I used?
> **VIPER**:

### VIPER is the industry's best and unbeatable when it comes to creating iOS architecture patterns with a model based on modular code-based theory. The roles of five VIPER architecture components are as follows:
- **View**: displays what it is told to by the Presenter and relays user input back to the Presenter.

- **Interactor**: contains the business logic as specified by a use case.

- **Presenter**: contains view logic for preparing content for display (as received from the Interactor) and for reacting to user inputs (by requesting new data from the Interactor).

- **Entity**: contains basic model objects used by the Interactor.

- **Routing**: contains navigation logic for describing which screens are shown in which order.
