## Which design pattern I used?
> MVVM offers some advantages over MVC:

- MVVM makes the view controller simpler by moving a lot of business logic out of it.
- The view model better expresses the business logic for the view.
- A view model is much easier to test than a view controller. You end up testing business logic without having to worry about view implementations.
