## Which design pattern I used?
> VIPER:

### VIPER is the industry's best and unbeatable when it comes to creating iOS architecture patterns with a model based on modular code-based theory. The roles of       five VIPER architecture components are as follows:
- View: displays what it is told to by the Presenter and relays user input back to the Presenter.

- Interactor: contains the business logic as specified by a use case.

- Presenter: contains view logic for preparing content for display (as received from the Interactor) and for reacting to user inputs (by requesting new data from     the Interactor).

- Entity: contains basic model objects used by the Interactor.

- Routing: contains navigation logic for describing which screens are shown in which order.
